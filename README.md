### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM CSS
- React Context
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned a lot about React Context, because i didn't want to pass props through all components. Also i learned how to update localStorage immediately
using useEffect hook.
